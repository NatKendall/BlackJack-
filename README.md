# BlackJack-

Description
One of my many python projects created with the focus of strengthening my sckills in methods, dictionaries, and loops. 
The program plays the classic blackjack game which gives the user a total of their two cards, asks 
to deal another if under 21 and plays against the dealer if qualified to see who wins. 


Blackjack objective?
Blackjack, or twenty-one, Card game whose object is to be dealt cards having a higher count 
than those of the dealer, up to but not exceeding 21. The dealer may use a single deck of 
52 cards or two or more decks from a holder called a shoe. Aces count as 1 or 11(exception in
my code the ace is set to 11), and face cards as 10. 

Below are a few runs of the program!
